This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website

And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.

Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.

<h3>
7 fucking declarations.

<p class="discription">
That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
</p>
<li class="discription">Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
<li class="discription"><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens
</li>
<li class="discription"><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers
</li>
<li class="discription">The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
<li class="discription">Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across
</li>
<h3>
And guess what, motherfucker:
</h3>
<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.
</p>
<h2>
Let it breathe
</h2>
<p class="cool">
Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <i>line-height: 1.4</i> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
<div>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
</div>
</p>
<h2>
A little less contrast
</h2>
<p>
Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <i>#EEEEEE</i> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
</p>
<h2>
Size Matters
</h2>
<p>
I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.
</p>
<h3 class="description">
Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck
</h3>
<p>
I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.
